# Posticino (Work in Progress)

Posticino is a personal project where I explore **mobile-first development** using **Expo** and **React Native**. Having always been web-focused, I wanted to step into the mobile world, and Expo immediately caught my attention—I had to dive deeper!  

## Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, React, TypeScript  
- **Backend:** TBD (currently focusing on the UI)  

This is my first time working with React Native and Expo, so the result might feel a bit amateurish—apologies in advance!  

## Project Overview  

The core idea of Posticino is still evolving (I’ve already mapped out all the flows in Miro), but you can think of it as a **travel web app**. More details will come as the project progresses!  

### Install dependencies:  
```sh
npm install
```
## Running the Project  

To start the project locally, make sure you have **Node.js** and **Expo CLI** installed.  
```
npx expo start
```
From there, you can scan the QR code with the Expo Go app or run the project in an emulator.
